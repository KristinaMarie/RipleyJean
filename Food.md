We recommend avoid introducing new food or snacks into her diet or you will be picking up some soft ðŸ’© 

Ripley typically eats 1.5 cup of dry food (Pawtree) a day, which typically equals out to three fills of the purple tape cup a day - breakfast, lunch, and dinner! We typically use the light/dark teal toy feeder for her meals to slow her down and distract her for a long as possible. You're welcome to also use the dark teal bowl if you need her to eat quick and don't feel like filling the other feeder, it is a little tedious.

In the morning, open the probiotic pill and sprinkle the powder over her dry food. She doesn't even notice it!

We also fill the front pocket her Patagona pouch each morning with freeze dried chicken (PureBites) for training activities and rewarding offered good behavior. 

She can also have 1 Dental Chew (sticks) a day, best paired with naptime.
