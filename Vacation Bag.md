What you can expect to find in Ripley's overnight kit: 
- [ ] **Crate / Den** : Ripley's preferred sleeping area. You might need to place her in her den with a dental chew or chewing toy to calm her down. She might bark for a few minutes, but should settle quickly if left alone and crate is covered. 
- [ ] **Towels & Blankets** : At least two blankets (den cover + bed) and one towel to dry her off if she gets dirty/wet 
- [ ] **Pee pads & Non-Marketing Spray** : She typically doesn't use pee pads, but just to be safe! She also is pretty good about going the bathroom outside, however if there is a spot another dog has marked she will find it! Prevent accidents by spraying those spots in advance. 
- [ ] **Food** : More on that here
- [ ] **Patagona Pack** : Ripley's to-go back, equipped with ðŸ’© bags, snack pocket, hand sanitizer and room for your keys/phone 
- [ ] **Dental Chew Sticks** : One per day please! Great for if you need to settle her in her den 
- [ ] **Toys** : She is teething, so if you see her biting anything give her a toy instead. She is pretty good about switching obsessions 
- [ ] **Clothing** : Likely a sweater she won't need, but why not - it's so cute!
