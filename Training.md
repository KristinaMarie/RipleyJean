# Positive Reinforcement Dog Training 
Justin and I do our best to adher to positive reinforcement, rather than aversive punishment or "[leader of the pack](https://todaysveterinarypractice.com/on-your-best-behavior-moving-beyond-leader-of-the-pack/)" methods. We find Ripley responds well when she is focus and food motivated (before big meals or just following). So what does this mean in practice? 

Training Behavior | Context | Examples | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Sit** | This is Ripley's Please and Thank You for everything. We are trying to master this skill, feel free to test and reward with small parts of chicken her on this regularly - a little reward goes a long way. | - Playing, like sitting before giving or throwing a toy, <br> - Before we cross a street outside, <br> - When something is overstimulating like a new dog walking in our direction or someone coming through the front door
| **Meals** | Making eye contact before sharing food helps build bonds and trust | Before giving her bowl, have her sit and ask for "eyes" - she should look at you for at least 5 seconds. I find she is more willing before breakfast and dinner. |
| **Trigger Words** | These words trigger a specific behavior, feel free to practice with her! | - "Ok" is used for a lot, often to distrupt behavior or release. For example if she is sitting outside at the corner and it's safe to cross the street, saying "ok" as you step forward will let her know it's safe to cross and she will sprint forward. Same with food! <br> - "Do Your Business ðŸ’©" is our fun way of reminding her it's time to go to the bathroom. She is really good at this first thing in the morning, we are still working on adoption throughout the day ðŸ˜‚ | 
| **No Offleash** | She is still working on coming back when her name is called. Unless a spot is completely fenced in, please keep her on leash. | If she does go missing, we have her microchipped and an Apple Airtag on her collar, please let us know ASAP |
